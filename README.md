# **Nobia Application Landscape**

This repository contains the Nobia Applciation Landscape model.

This model has been built using the ArchiMate modelling language and the Archi modelling tool.

More information about the ArchiMate language can be found [here](http://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/archimate3-doc/toc.html)

The Archi modelling tool that is used can be downloaded from [here](https://www.archimatetool.com/)

## *ArchiMate at Nobia* ##

The ArchiMate modelling language is designed to allow users to model the Application, Business, Technology layers of an IT architecture. In addition, it provides *extensions* that allow for modelling of Motivation, Implementation and Strategic elements of an architecture. In effect the full ArchiMate specifcation allows for high-level modelling of *anything* that might relate to an IT system/change.

Based on Nobia's requirements and to ease adoption we have decided to use a subset of the full ArchiMate notation when building the Nobia Enterprise Application Model (as per the diagram below).
